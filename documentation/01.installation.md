# Low Options for ExpressionEngine

Low Options displays the list items or options for a given channel field. These options are the values given in the settings of the field (eg: dropdown fields). If no such options are given (eg: regular text input fields), a list of unique values of that field will be generated based on the given parameters.

Requires **EE 3.0.0+** and is especially useful in combination with [Low Search](https://eeharbor.com/low-search). The EE2 compatible version [is available here](https://github.com/eeharbor/low_options/tree/ee2).

## Installation

- [Download](https://eeharbor.com/low_options) and unzip;
- Copy the `low_options` folder to your `system/user/addons` directory;
- In your Control Panel, go to the Add-on Manager and install Low Options;
- All set!
